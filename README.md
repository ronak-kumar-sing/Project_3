ðŸŒž Sunday Warm-up: Building Websites with HTML & CSS! ðŸŽ¨

Started my Sunday morning with a quick warm-up by creating a new webpage from scratch using HTML and CSS. Itâ€™s amazing to see how every detail comes together, from the layout to the styling, as I dive deeper into the world of web design with Sheryians Coding School.
